# CSLU Foreign Accented Speech Transcriptions

## [Emily Ahn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-ahn-50205472) and [Sravana Reddy](http://cs.wellesley.edu/~sravana/)

These are transcriptions for the  recordings in the [CLSU Foreign Accented Speech Corpus](http://www.cslu.ogi.edu/corpora/fae/) of non-native English speech. The transcriptions were provided by workers on Mechanical Turk.

Due to resource-constraints, we only collected transcriptions for about a third of the data, coming from native speakers of 7 of the 23 languages (Arabic, Czech, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Mandarin, and Korean).

If you use these transcriptions, please cite Emily's senior thesis, *A Computational Approach to Foreign Accent Classification*, Wellesley College, 2016, [available here](http://repository.wellesley.edu/thesiscollection/323/).
